Just a little update to let everyone know that I'm planning to start working on this project next week. These are very early days of TraVis and you can expect lots of changes and better OS compatibility and integration. One of the first changes I will make is to include license where necessary. For the time being you should know that the license is GPL.

TraVis (Trace Visualisation) is a final result of my dissertation. Its goal is to dynamically visualise what is happening inside of any program written in Java and to do it in safe and efficient manner. I aimed to provide a visualisation that, unlike class diagrams, is scalable, efficient and informative.

For instructions on how to use it please refer to UserGuide.pdf.

I spent just over two months (January 2011 to mid March 2011) writing the code of this program and have not touched it sinceâ€¦ It's about time to share it with everyone and hope other people find it as useful as people that have evaluated it. Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project.

My plans for near future are to refactor the code and use Maven for dependency management. While doing it my priorities will be to fix some bugs, provide tests and increase the efficiency.
